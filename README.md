# Near Express Stores 

- This project sticks to the marketplace theme but with a couple of new features, such as an account entitled to own a store, the owned store having products associated with it, a CRUD modal implemented on these features, a section that accepts product suggestions from users but with certain restrictions and the ability for a store to be rated by users. a link to the demo [here](https://near-express-stores.vercel.app/).
